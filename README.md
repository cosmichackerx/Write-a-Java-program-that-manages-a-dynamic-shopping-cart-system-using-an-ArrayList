# 📝 Program Statement (Assignment)

`Write-a-Java-program-that-manages-a-dynamic-shopping-cart-system-using-an-ArrayList
`

```
our program should:

Create an ArrayList of String type to store shopping cart items.

Add Elements → Add at least 5 items (including duplicates, e.g., “Milk” twice).

Access an Element → Display the first item in the cart.

Change an Element → Replace one item with a new one (e.g., change “Milk” to “Soy Milk”).

Remove an Element → Remove an item by index (e.g., remove the 3rd item).

ArrayList Size → Print the total number of items currently in the cart.

Loop Through an ArrayList → Display all items using a loop.

Other Types → Create a second ArrayList of Integer type for item quantities (e.g., [2, 1, 3…]).

Sort an ArrayList → Sort the shopping cart items alphabetically.

The var Keyword (Java 10+) → Use var to create another ArrayList for discount codes.

The List Interface → Declare the shopping cart as List<String> instead of ArrayList<String>.
```
